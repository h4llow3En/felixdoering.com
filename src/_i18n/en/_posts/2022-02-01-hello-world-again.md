## My reflections on the old website

Why do people create their own websites? Either to promote themselves or to tell their stories in blog form.  
But what would I like to achieve with my website? The previous iteration was a pure blog and a collection of projects I was working on at some point. Also the preceding blog entry was over four years ago and my style of writing has changed.
For this reason, I would now like to pull the main focus away from the blog, but nevertheless try to keep it somewhat more active than before.

## The new website

So what remains, what changes and what has yet to come?  
It remains my website, but its purpose has now shifted towards presenting myself. I also no longer liked my previous design, it was too sterile, too empty. The current one, although still simple, is more elegant in my opinion.  
I no longer wished to fall back on frameworks, which, no matter how far they can be configured, are always recognisable, I wanted to create something of my own.  
In addition, I decided a while ago that I do not want to know who comes to my site. Neither how nor why. Consequently, I removed all tools that provide me with statistics about this. This also saves me from having to deal with a cookie banner. No tracking, no external fonts hosted by Google and no integration of social media means no need for a banner.

So what will the future bring for this website?
Since I would very much like to publish this website, both the portfolio of projects and the playlist overview are not yet ready. For the latter, the [Tracktor API](https://github.com/tracktor-one/tracktor){:target="_blank"} must first be completed first and then the frontend part developed.

So there is still some work to be done until the site is the way I want it to be.
