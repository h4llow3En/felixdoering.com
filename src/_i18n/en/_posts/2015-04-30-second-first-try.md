This is now the second attempt to continuously run a blog. My first attempt failed in that at some point I no longer knew what to write, and then it fell into oblivion.
When I realised after more than half a year that I hadn't written a single entry, I decided to abandon the project for the time being.

Newly encouraged and inspired by [Justus](http://justus.science "External link: Website of Justus Adam") I have now decided to keep a public diary again. This time with the help of [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll "External link: Project website of Jekyll"). Drupal needed too much maintenance for me. Not only that, until everything is set up again, it takes time that I don't want to spend on it. There is also the possibility of using Wordpress, but that is not necessarily the best thing in the world...

All in all, I now have a relatively easy way to run my blog, hopefully my motivation will stay up!
So little by little I will also add other pages, like my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/h4llow3En "External link: My own profile on Github") or the photo blog called momendlos that I also run.
