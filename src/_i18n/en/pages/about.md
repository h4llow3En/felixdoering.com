# Hi, I'm Felix {#about-me}

My name is Felix DÃ¶ring and I am a software developer - and that out of passion, always in search of challenging problems.  
I deal with IT architectures and software development at all levels, from conception to implementation.

What to tell about me? - Sometimes prophecies come true.  
When I sat in front of my computer in my childhood, I must have made a very enthusiastic and curious impression. Because a family friend predicted a career in IT for me.  
I assembled my first PC myself at the age of 14. After my interest in hardware was quenched for the time being, I turned to software, driven by the curiosity about what you can do with a few lines of code. With the help of small scripts, I taught myself how to program.

The rest was pure logic: Computer science courses in high school and then studied in Dresden after graduation (Abitur).  
Unfortunately, I had to end my studies prematurely, but I still didn't want to give up my dream of becoming a computer scientist. That's why I applied for an apprenticeship with my current employer, 3m5. Media GmbH in my adopted city of Dresden.  
After successfully completing my training, I specialised in the field of DevOps. The term DevOps refers to a combination of *development*, i.e. the development of applications, and *IT operations*, i.e. the provision and operation of these.  

I'm currently pushing this field forward in addition to backend programming in Python and Kotlin/Java and hardware-related programming in C and C++.  
If I can find some time besides my personal projects, I create playlists together with Christoph Kepler.
